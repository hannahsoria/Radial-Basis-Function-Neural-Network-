# Radial Basis Function Neural Network 

The goal of this project is to implement a neural network and use it to classify handwritten digits in the MNIST image dataset: the network will predict which numeric digit 0-9 is contained in test images that are presented to it. This will use radial basis functions (RBF) in the neural network hidden layer (RBF network).
